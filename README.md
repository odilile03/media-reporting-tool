# Input - Output Form

Welcome to my repository for a simple **Input - Output Tool**, a user-friendly and highly functional UI designed to simplify requests for businesses and clients.

## Vision  

This project started as a response to a common challenge faced by media comapnies that provide reporting to their clients. There are several elements such as campaign flight dates, trafficking IDs, programmatic breakouts, and cost related features that can determine the desired output of a report and often times this information can be challenging and time intensive to confirm with the client for each report over the phone or email. This tool gives clients the ability to Input the request for their own report details and provides an Output in a format to help the media team build the report.

The core vision here extends beyond media reporting, reflecting this truth - simple, intuitive tools can empower businesses to achieve more with less effort.
